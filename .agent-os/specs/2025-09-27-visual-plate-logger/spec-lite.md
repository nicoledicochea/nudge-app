# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a visual plate logger that allows users to log a single meal per session using universal portion shapes (palm, fist, ping pong ball, etc.) instead of calorie counting. This feature provides an intuitive, mobile-first interface for meal logging that aligns with Nudge's gentle, non-judgmental approach to wellness tracking. This is the foundational meal logging experience for Phase 1.

Users can tap from twelve universal portion shapes (Palm, Ping Pong Ball, Fist, Cupped Hands, Smartphone, Ice Cream Scoop, Hockey Puck, Quarter, Shot Glass, Coffee Mug, Thumb Tip, Golf Ball), categorize them as Protein, Carb, Veggie, or Fat through a popup, and see them appear on a color-coded plate visualization. The system provides AI-powered feedback with gentle suggestions about meal balance based on portion categories, and integrates with the existing meal logging API to store visual meal data.
