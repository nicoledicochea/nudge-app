# Nudge App - Daily Development Tasks

## Phase 1: Basic Backend Setup

### Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Railway PostgreSQL database created
- [x] Node.js project initialized
- [x] Core dependencies installed (express, cors, dotenv, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, pg)
- [x] Environment variables configured (.env file)
- [x] Basic Express server created
- [x] Database connection working
- [x] Database tables created (users, meal_logs, check_ins)

### Authentication System
- [x] JWT middleware created (comprehensive auth with error handling)
- [x] User registration endpoint (/api/auth/register)
- [x] User login endpoint (/api/auth/login)
- [x] Password hashing with bcryptjs
- [x] Test user creation and login flow

### Core API Endpoints
- [x] Database getUserById function added
- [x] Meal logging route structure created (/api/meals/log)
- [x] Recent meals route created (/api/meals/recent)
- [x] Check-in logging endpoint (/api/checkins/log)
- [x] User profile endpoint (/api/users/profile)
- [x] Test all endpoints with proper authentication

### Basic Chat Interface (Non-RAG)
- [x] Simple chat endpoint (/api/chat)
- [x] Basic AI integration with Gemini API
- [x] Test chat responses without vector search
- [x] Gentle, encouraging response tone implementation

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test user registration flow
- [ ] Test meal logging with portions array
- [ ] Test authentication token generation/validation
- [ ] Test API error handling
- [ ] Verify database data persistence

## Phase 1.5: Frontend Connection (Optional for today)
- [ ] Basic React app setup
- [ ] Test API connection from frontend
- [ ] Simple login/register forms
- [ ] Basic meal logging interface

## Future Phases (Not for today)

### Phase 2: RAG Implementation
- [ ] ChromaDB setup and connection
- [ ] Vector database service creation
- [ ] OpenAI embeddings integration
- [ ] RAG-powered chat enhancement

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] The Why Wall implementation
- [ ] Non-Scale Victories tracker
- [ ] Movement Journey gamification


## Current Status
**Last Updated:** September 27, 2025
**Current Task:** âœ… Phase 1 Complete - All basic backend endpoints implemented
**Next Priority:** RAG Implementation (Phase 2)

## Notes
- âœ… Database connection secured (removed hardcoded credentials)
- âœ… All authentication endpoints working with JWT
- âœ… All CRUD endpoints implemented (meals, check-ins, users, chat)
- âœ… Gemini AI integration working
- ðŸš€ Ready for RAG implementation with ChromaDB and embeddings
- Minor debugging needed for registration endpoint error handling
